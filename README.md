💎 Diamond Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on their features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and other physical dimensions. Using machine learning models, the project helps in estimating diamond prices accurately, which can be useful for both buyers and sellers.

📂 Project Structure

The dataset contains the following main features:

Carat: Weight of the diamond

Cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

Color: Diamond color grading from D (best) to J (worst)

Clarity: Measurement of diamond inclusions (I1 to IF)

Depth: Total depth percentage

Table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point

Price: Price of the diamond (Target variable)

X, Y, Z: Physical dimensions of the diamond
